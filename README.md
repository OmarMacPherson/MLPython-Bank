# Machine Learning: Decision Tree Analysis for Bank Customer Churn

![Data Analyst Professional](https://github.com/OmarMacPherson/MLPython-Bank/blob/main/Python_with_link.png)

This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank by analyzing a dataset of over 10,000 records. Using machine learning techniques, specifically a decision tree model, the project identifies key factors that influence whether a customer will leave the bank. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, feature selection, and model building using Python.
